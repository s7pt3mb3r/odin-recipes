    <h2>Easy Homemade Pizza</h2>
    <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just <br>
        mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, <br>
        chewy crust.</p>
    
    <h2>Pizza Crust Ingredients</h2>
    <p>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple <i>pizza crust</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yeast </strong>Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes <br>the pizza dough to rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar </strong>To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. <br>
            The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the activation process. <br>
            You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread Flour </strong>Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. <br>
            This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil </strong>Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: <br>
            Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. <br>
            This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt </strong>A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the <br>
            gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to Roll Out Pizza Dough</h2>
    <p>Stretching pizza dough is the most hands-on part of the pizza crust-making process. <br>
        It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as pie (pun intended). <br>
        To shape the dough:</p>

    <h3>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature</h3>
    <p>After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest <br>
        on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax, <br>
        making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.</p>

    <h3>Prepare Your Surface With Oil</h3>
    <p>You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of <br>
        flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. <br>
        However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, <br>
        rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and <br>
        maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, <br>
        and ensure a gorgeous golden color.</p>

    <h3>Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. <br>
        Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. <br>
        No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. <br>
        Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you <br>
        should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about <br>
        â…“-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to <br>
        support the sauce and toppings.</p>
