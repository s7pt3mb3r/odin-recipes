    <h2>How to Make a Basic Beef Burger</h2>
    <p>Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. You'll find the full recipe <br>
        below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you <br>
        can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties: <br>

        Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Then, add <br>
        the ground beef and bread crumbs before forming the mixture into ¾-inch <br>
        patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to eight minutes <br>
        per side.
        
        Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, <br>
        and you're ready to go. Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and <br>
        mayo for full-fledged flavor.</p>
